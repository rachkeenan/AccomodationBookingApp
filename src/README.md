# BookingApplication

This application uses a C-sharp Console Application to create a database using Entity Framework Core and SQLite. 
Data is automatically added to the database through the console application, however it is important to note that the console application should only be ran once otherwise data will duplicate.

The WPF application allows you to search accomodations, add a booking, and you can also view the accomodation and booking data through the tabs
